# hacker-name

## Introduction

This is program that will give you a random hacker name. My hacker name is **H4CK L3G3ND 007**, and yours?

Why I did this? This project is given by codecademy in the Full Stack Engineer path course and it seemed very practical to finish putting all that recently learned knowledge in my head like javaScript, node Js, the Command line, Git and GitHub.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* Node js
